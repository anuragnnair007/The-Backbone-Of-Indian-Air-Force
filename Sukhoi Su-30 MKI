<body align="center">The Sukhoi Su30 MKI is a twin-engine twin-seater all-weather multirole fighter aircraft commonly known as the Flanker-H in NATO. It’s had been developed by the Russia’s Sukhoi Aerospace Corporation and is being built under license by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited ( HAL ) specifically for the Indian Air Force.
The development of the variant started in the 2000s after India signed a deal with Russia for the manufacturing of 140 Su30 jets. It was inducted into the Indian Air Force in 2002. At present, The Indian Air force operates nearly 272 Sukhoi Su-30 MKIs and the fighter is considered the backbone of the Indian air force for present and beyond. 

The fighter is derived from the tried and tested Su-27 and also shares similarities with the Su-35 due to its updated and derived avionics and navigation features from the French and Israeli air forces.
It is considered to have an upper edge when compared to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons, operated by the rivals, The Pakistan Air Force, and can easily tackle the American Fighter. Moreover, it is even considered the most upgraded version of the Su-30. Even the Su-30MKK, the Chinese version, isn’t well equipped with the modern features that the MKI possesses. 

Its super maneuverability makes it better in dog fights as compared to the 4th gen American fighters and that may be the main reason behind the fleet expansion of this fighter in the Indian air force.
It also supports the newly developed Astra missile. Also the world’s fastest cruise missile ‘Brahmos' can be launched from this air superiority fighter. 
Thus, due to these unique features, the fleet of 272 Su-30 MKIs in the Indian Air Force can be considered as the backbone of the Indian Air Force.</body>
